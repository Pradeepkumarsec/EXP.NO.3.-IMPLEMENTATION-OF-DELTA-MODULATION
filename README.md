# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION
  
## AIM: 
 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit.
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED:
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V).

## PROCEDURE:
1.	Connections are to be given as per the block diagram. 
2.	Observe the modulated waveforms. 
3.	Measure the amplitude and time period of both the waveforms. 
4.	Plot the graph.
